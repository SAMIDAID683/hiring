# Senior Data Analyst

**Company**

We are a small growing and profitable software company that is building the future of spreadsheet-driven business applications. Some of our products include [YAMM](https://yamm.com/), [Awesome Table](https://awesome-table.com/) and [Form Publisher](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/form_publisher_approval_workflow/827172627657). They are some of the most popular products in the Google Workspace marketplace.

Our team is global (we have people based in France, Italy, Serbia, Bulgaria, Russia, US, Philippines, UK, Ireland), highly motivated and competent. We are a remote first company: anyone can work fully remotely. We also have offices in Paris and Milan if that’s more your thing.

We’re a transparent organization. Important metrics and numbers are communicated to all team members. Decisions are discussed collaboratively, not behind closed doors. If you value being part of the discussions on how to shape the future of the product, by giving your input, weighing in and being heard, then you might just be happy to work with us.

*   As a problem solver, you ask your own questions and you are excited about diving into unchartered datasets to explore them
*   You are excited about building new pipelines on top of the best cloud platform in the world: GCP, and use tools such as Data studio, BigQuery, Airflow, dbt, singer
*   Our legacy datasets are a bit of a mess, this shouldn’t scare you.
