**Job**

Do you like having some creative freedom where your ideas can be easily discussed and implemented in a small and dynamic company? How about being able to have a high impact on a product with millions of users? Do you like spreadsheets and SQL? You’ve knocked at the right door.

We are looking for a highly motivated Senior Data Analyst to join our growing team! You will report to the Lead Data Analyst and work closely with the Product and Engineering teams.

*   You care a lot about making data understandable and are a great explainer
*   As a problem solver, you ask your own questions and you are excited about diving into unchartered datasets to explore them
*   You are excited about building new pipelines on top of the best cloud platform in the world: GCP, and use tools such as Data studio, BigQuery, Airflow, dbt, singer
*   Our legacy datasets are a bit of a mess, this shouldn’t scare you.

**Your qualifications:**

*   Paid parental leave

**How to apply:**

We want to get a sense of how you think and write. To that end, please send us an email  the following questions:

*   Tell us why you want this job, not just any job
*   Tell us about what you like and dislike about SQL

Attach your resume, and any public profile or material you feel relevant to [stan@talarian.io](mailto:stan@talarian.io)

We will first ask you a few targeted questions to be answered by email so as to get acquainted to you in writing. If that goes well, we’ll send you a “data analyst test”. You’ll then move on to an interview with the Data team and then with the CEO
