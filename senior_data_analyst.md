We’re a small, growing, and profitable software company that is building the future of spreadsheet-driven business applications.

Our company is just under 40 people, 100% remote and truly global (we have people spread out across Europe, Africa, Asia and America), all highly motivated and dedicated.

We’re a transparent organization. Important metrics and numbers are communicated to all team members. Decisions are discussed collaboratively, not behind closed doors. If you value being part of the discussions on how to shape the future of the product, by giving your input, weighing in and being heard, then you might just be happy to work with us.

Our product values are: **simplicity**, **empowerment**, and **getting out of the way.**

**Job description**

Do you like having some creative freedom where your ideas can be easily discussed and implemented in a small and dynamic company? How about being able to have a high impact on products with millions of users? Do you like spreadsheets and SQL? You’ve knocked at the right door.

We are looking for a highly motivated Senior Data Analyst to join our growing data team! The data team is currently 4 people (3 data analysts, 1 data eng) and is working with awesome technologies such as Google Bigquery and dbt.

You will work closely with the CEO and the Marketing and Engineering teams.

**Core responsibilities:**

* Coordinate with the developers to help specify and maintain data dictionaries and logs, to ensure we are logging and storing correct data at the right time. 

**How the data team works:**



* The data team is currently composed of 2 data analysts, 1 lead data analyst and 1 data engineer. This allows us to work on different and varied subjects depending on priorities, our preferences and skills.
* Every Friday we plan the main priorities for the following week, then we readjust on a daily basis if needed. 
* Communication is done through email, Google Docs, Slack and Google meet. We share our data findings directly with the CEO through a daily meeting and with the wider team through dashboards and presentations during the weekly meetings.
* As a team we really enjoy sharing our progress and difficulties with each other. There is always someone who will be happy to help you! 
* Every two weeks we also have a feedback session where we reflect on what was good and what we should improve as a team. 

**You:**



* Are really good with numbers - in both the accountant way (producing correct numbers with a correct process) and the physicist way (you have a real physical feel for numbers, and frame problems as equations)
* Love spreadsheets and SQL
* Like making nice visual representations of the data, whether ad hoc spreadsheet charts or real-time updating dashboards
* You care a lot about making data understandable and are a great at explaining your thoughts
* As a problem solver, you ask your own questions and are excited about diving into unchartered datasets to explore them
* You’re not scared of messy legacy data sets
