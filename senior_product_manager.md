# Senior Product Manager

## Company

[Talarian](http://talarian.io) is a small, growing, and profitable software company that is building the future of spreadsheet-driven business applications. Some of our products include, [YAMM](https://yamm.com/),[ Awesome Table](https://awesome-table.com/), and [Form Publisher](https://form-publisher.com). They are used and loved by millions and some of the most popular products in the Google Workspace marketplace.

Our company is around 30 people, remote-first and global (we have people based in Western and Eastern Europe, Philippines, Nigeria), all highly motivated and dedicated.

Our product values are: simplicity, empowerment, and getting out of the way.


## Job description

We are looking for highly motivated Senior Product Managers to lead each of our three products.

* YAMM is a simple product that lets users send and track personalised emails in bulk from their Gmail account, directly from Google Sheets and Gmail.
* Form Publisher is a lightweight tool for digitizing and automating document-centric processes that start with Google Forms or Google Sheets.
* Awesome Table started as an easy way to display Google Sheets data on websites, and is adding a big new capability soon that will continue to make it easier for people to work with data in Google Sheets

## Here’s a few reasons why it’s interesting to take that job

* We are operating profitably, and have real product/market fit: each product has a large user base (millions of users and thousands of customers), and our users really like our products and customer service, as you can see from the reviews online
* Talarian’s market is global (65% AM, 25% EMEA, 15% APAC) with users from all types of organisations (corporate, healthcare practitioners, NGO’s, schools...) and there are many different use-cases as a result
* The products try to “get out of the way” and integrate seamlessly in tools they already use (Google Sheets…)  and so are composed of many sub-products: Google Workspace add-ons, web dashboards, email notifications, making it a rich and varied surface area to work on
* There are many directions these product can go into (simpler and more accessible, more and richer features, more integrations…), making this mission very open-ended
* There are a lot of complex engineering problems to solve behind the scenes in order to improve simplicity and flexibility
* Maintaining and improving reliability at this scale while launching new features is a genuine challenge

 
The acting PM on each product is the CEO, so you’ll be the first to take on that role full-time. Each product has a small team (<=7 people), so you won’t be one of a hundred and your impact will be felt inside and outside the company. This also means that this is a full-stack hands-on rolled-up sleeves role. People who want a pure “strategy consulting” job and don’t want to get their hands dirty need not apply. In order to do your job well, you will have to get neck-deep into technical details and arcane customer support issues.

The Senior Product Manager will report to the CEO and work closely with the Engineering, Support and Marketing teams. One career path for the right candidate, should she want it, is to become CEO of the product business unit (meaning manage the P&L and the team).

## Core responsibilities

* Write functional specifications for everything: new features, bug fixes, billing system upgrades, etc. Break down the specs into Jira tickets
* Coordinate and plan development, releases and issue remediation with Engineering, Technical Writers, Support and Marketing
* Talk to customers and track key metrics
* Drive the roadmap conversation with various stakeholders to achieve growth and customer satisfaction

## Most of those describe you

* You’re a problem solver at heart and you love getting to the bottom of things. You are very logical and detail oriented.
* As an expert of nothing, you understand that your role is to ask questions and then structure and synthesize the answers you get.
* You excel at writing and you like it. You write clearly and concisely. You care about every single word, about formatting, about presentation.You do not content yourself with boring bullet-point lists, you synthesize and you like to tell a good story. You are also very good at verbal communication
* You are not necessarily a good coder, but you are technical and understand how software is built (front-end, back-end, APIs, etc).
* You like making spreadsheets and automating things
* You work for users and customers primarily. You want to talk to customers.
* You have a good sense of what makes a great product, and an eye for design
* Ideally, you have some leadership experience

## Requirements

* **Experience:** 5+ years of experience in a product management at a software company, preferably a SaaS 
* **Language:** completely fluent English, French is a plus but not necessary. Did I mention you should write well?
* **Project management:** Our products have a ton of users, and prioritisation can be really challenging. You need to be extremely organized and flexible.
* **Tools:** you know and love Google Workspace, and ideally, you have experience with Jira, Github, Zendesk or equivalent

## Benefits

* A good compensation that gives you financial peace of mind, wherever you live
* 30 days of paid time off
* Medical, dental and vision insurance (depending on the type of contract)
* Paid parental leave

## How to apply

We want to get a sense of how you write and think. To that end, please write an email that covers at least the following:
-   Tell us why you you think our products are interesting
-   Provide a spec or a link to something you have written
-   Tell us which statements don’t fit you in the list of qualities above, and how you make up for it
-   Ask some questions you might have

We value great writers, so take your time with the application. Don't write about abstract frameworks of thought, only concrete things. Stock cover letters won’t do.

Send your email and resume to [stan@talarian.io](mailto:stan@talarian.io)

## Interview process

1.  We will first ask you a few targeted questions to be answered by email so as to get acquainted with you in writing.
2.  If that goes well, we’ll send you a product test, consisting of writing a spec and a little strategy exercise
3.  You’ll then move on to an interview with a Lead Engineer
4.  Finally, an interview with the CEO and CTO

We can’t wait to hear from you!
